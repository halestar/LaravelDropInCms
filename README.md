# Laravel Drop-In Content Management System
## DiCMS for short

DiCMS is a content management system (CMS) made for programmers and people that need a simple CMS that gets out of the way. The issue with most CMS is that they try to do eveything for you. Every CMS out there comes with it's own permissions package, or users package or management for assets, etc.  As a web app programmer most of the apps we build are internal apps. They come with a wonderful admin panel and maybe a users area or such, but the front side is usually left as an empty space with a promise "to be filled..."

So I built a simple CMS that is extensible with the following goals:

 - No Users: The system will not be bothered with users.
 - No Permissions: The system will not come with any permissions system.
 - Separation of Code: The CMS should be a package that you import, set up and then concentrate on building your front page.
 - Structure over Form: This is not a full-blown CMS system that lets you do everything under the sun and build your dream web page. If you want that, go use [Word Press](https://wordpress.com/) they have an amazing interface and more plugins that you will ever need. This CMS will be basic and structured for web sites.
 - Made for Programmers: This CMS is not for the end-user. It's made for programmers so that they can throw something together in **front** of their brand-new, awesome new app they just built.
 - Security is a Must: Just because we don't deal with permissions or users doesn't mean that they're not there in the system. They system should be able to be protected with permissions, users and the rest. They should just not get in the way. 

## WARNING!!!
All of this is beta until I get to a 1.0 release. Even this document is not actually done. Use with extreme caution.
